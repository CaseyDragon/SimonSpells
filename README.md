# SimonSpells

## General Info
This project was created to help children learning to spell, but can be enjoyed by all ages. It was specifically designed with dyslexics in mind. The blue backgrounds allow for easier reading and letter recognition as well as the letter by letter format allowing for the spelling to be more based on matching than simply phonetic recall.

The game starts when a player clicks start and "Simon" chooses a word. Then the word is displayed letter by letter as the player continues to copy the letters until the word is complete. If an incorrect answer is "checked" the game offers encouragement to try again and the word is restarted as to reenforce the letter order of the game. Upon completion of the game, the player is rewarded with a congratulations screen and offered another word.

### Technologies
This project was created with:
Javascript

#### Setup
This game is designed to be run in a web browser only.

##### User Stories
 Target users of this game would be children and adults who struggle with spelling and want to practice in a way that is effective and less stressful than traditional methods. They may struggle with breaking words into phenomes or visual tracking both of which are addressed in this game. They may need more time or multiple tries to get the word correct without feeling as if they have failed or lost. They want encouragement as they make the attempts not just when they succeed.

###### Wireframes and Design


###### Future of this game
I hope to continue work on this game as it is now limited to just 5 letter words that are manually put in. One idea for this game is to call on a random word api to increase the words to spell. Another possibility is to create multiple levels that start with smaller words and increase in size and difficulty.
